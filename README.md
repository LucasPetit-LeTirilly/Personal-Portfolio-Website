Codebase for Lucas Petit - Le Tirilly's Web Portfolio

## To be done

-Resize with css the skills bubbles, currently working on the english file, when all is done c/c the en file to the french file (don't forget that the alt of the images in the french files must be in french)
-On mobile display (images from the carousel are not centered and can be hard to read, especially the code screen capture from the node.js project)
-rework the code so that no "any" is used to bypass typescript's checking (notably I remember using "any" for the types of the props)
-Check if i18n routing works
